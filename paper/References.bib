abstract = "The estimation of the magnitude of extreme winds, and of the risk of their being exceeded, is an essential part of the assessment of wind loads on structures. This paper surveys the various methods available for extreme value analysis which are directly applicable to wind data. These are of two types: those making use of a sampling procedure to derive the parameters of an extreme value distribution, and those which make estimates directly from the total or parent population of wind speeds. The former is a well established technique appropriate to the majority of applications, and will be described in greater detail. There is some disagreement among wind engineers as to the correct or most useful analytic form for the extreme value distribution of winds. In this paper it is argued that for temperate latitudes, where fully developed weather systems are the dominant cause of strong winds, the extreme value distribution is a Fisher-Tippett (Type I). There is a sound theoretical basis for the use of this distribution. In regions where there is a significant risk of strong winds originating from tropical cyclones and tornadoes a Fisher-Tippett (Type II) distribution may possess certain practical advantages, but a full solution of the problem of wind prediction in these areas should be based upon a different statistical approach, tailored to model these particular wind phenomena. This requires development and an accumulation of suitable meteorological data before it can be fully implemented. Brief mention is made of methods of estimating extreme winds from the parent population of wind speeds. This has application in cases where there is a very limited length of meteorological records, and also for the analysis of extremes on a directional basis where the more common methods are inapplicable. The paper is concerned with principles and does not include a detailed mathematical treatment of the topic, which should be south in the references. "

Its main advantage is that it makes use of all relevant data on the high wind gusts produced by the storms of interest, not just the annual maxima, and it is not necessary to have a value for every year to carry out the analysis. The \{GPD\} is closely related to the generalized extreme value distribution (GEVD), and can be used to determine the appropriate value of shape factor, k, for use in the GEVD. However, a negative shape factor, corresponding to a Type \{II\} GEVD, is physically unrealistic, and should be avoided for long-term wind speed predictions. "

Results are presented for several tall buildings, for which wind tunnel model tests have been made, as well as for hypothetical buildings with generic aerodynamic signatures. Predictions of extreme wind loads and responses are made in both extra-tropical and tropical wind climates. Three of the analysis methods, namely the worst-case approach, the sector-by-sector method, and the up-crossings method are probabilistic procedures which rely on historical wind records. Also discussed is a time-domain analysis which tracks wind loads and responses during the passage of particular storms. This requires time histories of wind speed and direction that at this time are only available for tropical storms, where Monte Carlo simulations are used to determine time histories of the wind field. Directional factors are extracted from all predictions made in this study. These factors provide direct comparisons of extremes wind loads and effects predicted with particular methods of analysis to the corresponding predictions made with the worst-case method, which does not recognize the azimuthal variation of the aerodynamic data or the directional preferences of severe winds.

Four questions arise: what is the appropriate length of a single run in the wind tunnel, what is the appropriate fractile of the observed extreme coefficients, how many independent experiments are required to estimate this fractile and what should be the target confidence interval. The paper tries to give some answers to these questions and discusses the findings in regard to some wind load codes. "
